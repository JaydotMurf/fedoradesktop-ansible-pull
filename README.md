# fedoradesktop-ansible-pull-
#CAO : 17 June 20222

This is where the collection of config file and scripts for my automated/custom Fedora Workstation deployent live. 

The foundation of this repo was built using a tutorial from LearnLinuxTV ( One of my favorite Linux youtube pages )

The scripts in this repo leverage the 'Ansible-Pull' CMD tool.
