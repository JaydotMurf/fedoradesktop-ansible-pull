# fedoradesktop-ansible-pull
#CAO : 17 June 20222

This is where my collection of automated/custom configs for Fedora Desktop live. 

The foundation of this repo was built using a tutorial from LearnLinuxTV ( One of my favorite Linux youtube pages )

The scripts in this repo leverage the 'Ansible-Pull' CMD tool.`
